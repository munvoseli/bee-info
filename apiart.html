<blockquote>
<p>
The whole thing began earlier this year [2020]
when esolangs started really liking bees, which picked up in May.
"Apioforms" were invented by Heavpoot in early July,
and spread out of direct messages to here [esolangs discord] a week or so later.
Anyway, after the initial introduction of apioforms
came the heav-4 apioform game.
This helped popularize the word, and was quite fun.
</p>
<p>
"Apioform" began to be used as an insult-type thing soon afterward.
They were catapulted back into (greater) prominence
after the release of "beware apioforms" in mid-August.<sup>[condensation of correction]</sup>
The well-known "beware apioforms" video
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MeyArZuHlA)
spawned
"beware apioforms / they strike at night / you will never see them coming".
</p>
<p>
Around this time the APIONET IRC network was started up, mostly as a joke.
As far as I can tell, "apiohazard" was never very popular though.
I think the first prefixed versions of "apioform" were stuff like
cryoapioform/pyroapioform, in heavpoot's game.
This was popularized by ABR ++apioform.
</p>
...
<p>
We got other "form"-type things at some point, like avioforms and carcinoforms.

<blockquote>
<p>Apioforms are hostile apioids found in 93.34% of spacetime[1].
They have been known to attack various lifeforms, avoiding them is advised.
Increased activity has been shown when it is perceived to be night
or some equivalent by sentient beings nearby[1][2].
Antimemetic properties have been detected; experiments show that
apioforms are very difficult to perceive unless being attacked by them,
for unknown reasons[3].</p>

<p>Many types of bees are known to be apioforms,
but contrary to popular belief, not all of them are.</p>

<p>Apioforms are studied as part of apiology, which notably includes apiomemetics.
They have many uses in apionic reactions, bee analysis, apioform analysis,
apioweaponry and many other things.</p>

<li>apionic bee-apiator, machine that needs sunlight to fire bee-am.
powered by apion radiation, which bees emit.
also maybe powered by large octagon which emits bee energy.</li>
<li>bee energy beams can be split, reflected, routed, resisted, capacitated,
looped, and put into a power hexagon.</li>

<p>Much ORB lore is done through RP between _fragment and caesar.</p>

<p>According to an employee of the ORB,
the ORB is the source of spheroid 1, magenta, and apioforms 7-27065 inclusive.

<h2>Mind spiders</h2>

<p>
mind spiders are also extant on apionet.
heav and munvoseli both believe that they invented mind spiders.
</p>
<p>
munvoseli had conceptions of "stick spiders" and memetohazards
before encountering heav's mind spiders.
it is possible that munvoseli came across heav's mind spiders,
forgot about heav's mind spiders,
and retroactively remembered munvoseli's memetohazards as mind spiders.
